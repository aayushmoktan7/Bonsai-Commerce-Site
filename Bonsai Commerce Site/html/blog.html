        <div>
            <p class="descpara1"> Advantages Of Modern Technologies:<br>
                -Better Communication: Where there are modern technologies there are various means of communication
                mediums
                such as: email, skype, Facebook etc. due to which we can communicate with anyone around the globe,

                various technologies by which students can learn and understand learning, for example during the
                pandemic
                zoom and google classroom were of great help in learning.<br>

            <p class="descpara1"> Disadvantages of Modern Technologies:<br>
                -Distraction in daily life if not used properly: Lack of interest in studying and the period that
                explains
                this well was during the pandemic, the students were learning with help of zoom and classroom but they
                were
                also let free so most of them were busy playing games and scrolling their Facebook and Instagram
                feed.<br>
                -Security Issue: As there are many new technologies there are many pot holes and defects on those newly
                created ones, so it may not be fully secure to use them but there is always something bad in something
                good
                so we must learn to accept and with the defects, they will be corrected and made secure in few
                weeks.<br>
                -Plagiarism and copyright: This is mostly for the people related to IT and computer fields, the ones who
                created or made something can get easily stolen or copied by others, which is illegal but if the creator
                allows to copy then there is no problem. There has been many cases of copyright even in other fields as
                Modern technologies grow.<br>
            </p>

                advanced, technology will be in every sectors and people will use and adapt with these technologies like
                an
                organ part of their body. </p>
